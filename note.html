<p>We had a bit of a staff discussion about this post, and decided that you’re likely a well-intentioned individual who is just starting to learn about software development and open source.</p>
<p>Malcolm’s question to you in the thread was a pretty reasonable question - it is not typical to distribute software by sticking a zip file on github and asking folks to download, install, and provide ideas.  I was one of a few who pulled it down to see if it had any malware in it, as leaving a link like that in the forums would be problematic for us as a community.</p>
<p>Because of our determination, we have opted instead to provide some friendly advice about how best to proceed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by using github as it is intended - as a source code repository.  By using it properly, you can let those who are interested in your project see how the code evolves over time.  That also will help you track issues (as they are reported in github) and allow others to contribute ideas.</li>
<li>In your installation script, DO NOT - even if it is commented out - include commands that modify peoples’ systems.  The sudo commands to enable and start sshd are completely unnecessary for your code to function.</li>
<li>I noticed when setting up your software that you’ve included advertising links in the code (and those are presented as pop-up ads in the UI).  That’s just poor form, and makes it look like the software is just going to spam people with what I assume are your local businesses.  I get that you might be looking for ways to monetize the use of your software down the road, but asking for people to contribute “premium type features” for free and then trying to make money off of those ideas is going to leave a bad taste in peoples’ mouths.</li>
<li>I also noticed that the software requires an NPM module that’s not installed by default (I forget which one now, but as the author, you should be able to determine which one fairly easily).</li>
<li>Your instructions on usage are unclear.  You say “download NEW_SERVER.zip”, but the script to run or install it (which really should be separate scripts) then downloads the old zip file and unzips it, overwriting what’s unzipped from the new ZIP file.  As with other things I’ve noted, this makes it look like something fishy is going on - because you download something else and then immediately run that rather than what the downloader downloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these things that you have done make it look like the code is straight up malware posing as something else. Combining that with saying “I can’t host it for technical reasons, so to give me ideas, you need to install it on your own system”  <em>really</em> adds to that feeling that your intentions are not “above board”.</p>
<p>Again, we opted to read this as inexperience rather than as malicious intent, and to provide feedback after removing your post from public view.</p>
<p>We do hope that we are correct in that assessment.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls collapsed"><div class="actions"><div class="double-button"><button class="widget-button btn-flat toggle-like like no-text btn-icon" title="like this post" data-post-id="1188840"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-d-unliked svg-icon svg-node" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-thumbs-up"></use></svg></button></div><button class="widget-button btn-flat share no-text btn-icon" title="share a link to this post"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-d-post-share svg-icon svg-node" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></button><button class="widget-button btn-flat show-more-actions no-text btn-icon" title="show more"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-ellipsis-h svg-icon svg-node" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#ellipsis-h"></use></svg></button><button class="widget-button btn-flat reply create fade-out btn-icon-text" title="begin composing a reply to this post" aria-label="Reply to post #1 by @hendersj"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-reply svg-icon svg-node" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#reply"></use></svg><span class="d-button-label">Reply</span></button></div></nav></section></div><section class="post-actions">
